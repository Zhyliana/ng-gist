# ng-gist

Simple Angular web app to display, filter, create, edit, and delete gists.

## Quick Start
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:Zhyliana/ng-gist.git
$ cd ng-gist
$ npm start
```
Navigate to `localhost:8000` on any browser.

## Next Steps:
- Write unit tests using jasmine and mocha-chai + sinon for easy stubbing of promises and $http calls.
- Use webpack to compile our files and dependencies. 
- Use ES2015 syntax to facilitate the reusability of providers, directives, etc. across modules.
